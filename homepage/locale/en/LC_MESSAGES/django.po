msgstr "I’ve been writing for a few years now and I have lots of ideas. From urban fantasy stories, when you’ve just seen an inspiring series, to interesting crazy ideas in other genres, to high fantasy epics with a specially created world and magic - everything exists in my head. Some you pursue for a while and then discard, others develop and others you save for later. I’m currently working on two projects that I’d like to briefly introduce here. One of them is ready to be published, the other is just an idea in my head for now."
